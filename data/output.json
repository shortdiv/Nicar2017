However, Wells could not report on racist violence from a detached vantage point. She had friends who were murdered and was herself exiled from her home in Memphis after her newspaper's office was ransacked and her life was threatened. Many buying homes or choosing schools for their children, including reporters and editors, are implicated in systems intertwined with race, class and politics. However, few acknowledge that they aren't detached from these systems. Last year, Nikole Hannah-Jones used her background reporting about race, segregation and education to show how [her own experience choosing a school for her daughter](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/magazine/choosing-a-school-for-my-daughter-in-a-segregated-city.html?_r=0) exemplified broader issues in American education. Lewis Wallace, a reporter for Marketplace, reported being fired after publishing an [essay](https://medium.com/@lewispants/objectivity-is-dead-and-im-okay-with-it-7fd2b4b5c58f#.yzkh8bigt) questioning the reality of standards of objectivity and neutrality in news and surfacing the struggles he faces as a trans person who is specifically affected by policy.Let's start by accepting that objectivity and neutrality aren't real and that there is a crisis of audience trust in reporting. Let's also aknowledge that reporters and editors are consciously or unconciously implicated in many of the dynamics on which they cover, yet still do rigorous work. Finally, let's agree that not everyone in a newsroom is impacted by newsworthy events in the same way.From this starting point, let's talk about different standards that journalists are developing, either in their own practice, or at their organizations to address our personal implications in the news. How can or should reporters disclose their connections or orientations? What are the implications, if any, if reporters participate in protests or donate to causes? How have reporters taken political actions but remained fair and truthful in the reporting? What were the times when this wasn't possible? From this conversation, I hope we can develop sets of standards, personal and organizational that prioritize both our humanity and the integrity of our journalism. ",
